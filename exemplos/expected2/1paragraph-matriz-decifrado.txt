To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I ha
ve seldom heard himmention her under any other n
ame. In his eyes she eclipses andpredominates th
e whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any 
emotionakin to love for Irene Adler. All emotion
s, and that one particularly,were abhorrent to h
is cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He
was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and o
bserving machine thatthe world has seen, but as 
a lover he would have placed himself in afalse p
osition. He never spoke of the softer passions, 
save with a gibeand a sneer. They were admirable
 things for the observer-excellent fordrawing th
e veil from mens motives and actions. But for th
e trainedreasoner to admit such intrusions into 
his own delicate and finelyadjusted temperament 
was to introduce a distracting factor which migh
tthrow a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit
 in a sensitiveinstrument, or a crack in one of 
his own high-power lenses, would notbe more dist
urbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as
 his. Andyet there was but one woman to him, and
 that woman was the late IreneAdler, of dubious 
and questionable memory.
